# ABOUT PROJECT
IT products in the field of public health protection are growing day by day all over the world. Previously, computers and their devices were used in the main developed countries in the field of public health protection. However, nowadays, developing countries are also moving towards this. The coverage of cellular networks in most areas of the state makes everyone interested in using mobile phones. And because of this, the usage of phones has increased over the past couple of years. Due to the change, the user society insists on developing programs for the phone and websites. Now the user can use most of all desktop applications and websites on their own phones. Even people of medical services and patients feel comfortable using mobile devices to make patient records and/or the process of diagnosing patients or as online records.
